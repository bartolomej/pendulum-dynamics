# Pendulum Dynamics

This is a visualization of dynamics of a pendulum.
Pendulum's displacement angle *Î¸* (theta) and angular velocity (theta dot) are represented as *x* and *y* coordinates.
The change of theta (velocity) and the change of velocity (acceleration) are the *x* and *y* components of a vector that shows the current "state" of the dynamical system.
